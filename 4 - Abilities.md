## Ability Checks
When a player wants to complete a challenging task such as climbing a tree, racing against a rabbit, or searching for firewood they make a ability check. by rolling two dice and taking the best result.

### Before The Roll
The Narrator determiners a number that represent the difficulty of task. They have two options.
1) The narrator thinks of a fair number in the context of the story 
2) The narrator has a collection difficulty charts that represents many different tasks. If they find chart that seems fair to use for the task then they can choose to use it.

### After The Roll 
- If the player has perviously earned any bonuses that they noted in their Character Book they then add it to their result.
- The Narrator may also give the player additional conditional bonus if they make sense to the story.  


- If the number the player rolls is higher than the difficulty number that Narrator decided they player completes the task.

If a player rolls doubles of any number they automatically complete the task.
