# Mini RPG System
A mini RPG system intended to be a functional set of rules for RPG themed zines and art books. 

Currently in development with intent to be licensed under CC BY-SA or OGL once I have figured out what terms and ideas will be used in the open rule set separate from the project that I want to retain ownership of.
